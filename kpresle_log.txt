27 May (2 hours) Reading Galant source code, trying to figure out how the graph state changes are manifested and propogates, so that I can exchange control between master and worker thread appropriately
26 May (1 hour) Reading OReilly book on Git to try and understand it better
25 May (~1.5 hours) Thinking about new model for implementing Galant threading (as on papers shown on Tuesday's meeting) and thinking of way to do faster regression testing
22 May (~4 hours) Regression testing; hacking up the GUI; trying to implement so that Galant will run algorithm in steps (no support for reversing)
21 May (~2 hours) Trying to turn Algorith into a Runnable; discovering that Galant seems to be broken; trying to figure out when/where/why this happened; also fixed a bug in the Node.java that was causing a (non-fatal) exception
20 May (~2 hours) reading Galant code; reading book on Git and trying to figure it out
19 May (~7 hours) reading Java tutorials on threading and monitors; implementing the basic galantThreading project submitted to Dr. Stallmann that had a worker and controler
