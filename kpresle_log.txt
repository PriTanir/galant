11 June (3.5 hours) Trying to understand the GUI; learning about Swing; added a panel to the GUI that will print out the graph state each time & display if in the midst of running the set-up
6-7 June (7.5 hours) Algorithm is (I think) now being run in bits and pieces.  I'm still unable to step through it correctly, but I've added printouts to the log and I think things are going well
04 June (3.5 hours) Better understanding of how the algorithm is being run; now have it pausing after doing the "set up" stage; still don't have it passing control correctly
31 May (2 hours) Managed to break Galant; now it claims to have run the algorithm but won't actually display it.  I think I'm not passing my Thread object around correctly
29 May (6 hours) Trying to figure out how graph state changes are kept; trying to figure out where to declare and invoke worker thread; modified the GraphState and Galant.java files (albeit incorrectly); struggling with Git and version changes; modified so that it *should* run algorithm until it's finished initializing, then have it wait; next I'll need to wake up the algorithm when the GraphState is incremented, run a step, and then sleep it again
27 May (2 hours) Reading Galant source code, trying to figure out how the graph state changes are manifested and propogates, so that I can exchange control between master and worker thread appropriately
26 May (1 hour) Reading OReilly book on Git to try and understand it better
25 May (~1.5 hours) Thinking about new model for implementing Galant threading (as on papers shown on Tuesday's meeting) and thinking of way to do faster regression testing
22 May (~4 hours) Regression testing; hacking up the GUI; trying to implement so that Galant will run algorithm in steps (no support for reversing)
21 May (~2 hours) Trying to turn Algorith into a Runnable; discovering that Galant seems to be broken; trying to figure out when/where/why this happened; also fixed a bug in the Node.java that was causing a (non-fatal) exception
20 May (~2 hours) reading Galant code; reading book on Git and trying to figure it out
19 May (~7 hours) reading Java tutorials on threading and monitors; implementing the basic galantThreading project submitted to Dr. Stallmann that had a worker and controler
