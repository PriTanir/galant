<h2>Galant Algorithm Examples</h2>


<ul>
<br><hr>
<li><b><a href=bfs.alg>bfs.alg</a></b> 
<br>
Implementation of breadth-first search. Undirected edges are regarded as<br>
being directed both ways.<br>
<br>
<br><hr>
<li><b><a href=binary_tree.alg>binary_tree.alg</a></b> 
<br>
Draws a binary tree that fits into current graph window. First queries the<br>
user about the tree height.<br>
<br>
<br><hr>
<li><b><a href=boruvka.alg>boruvka.alg</a></b> 
<br>
@file boruvka.alg<br>
implementation of Boruvka's MST algorithm, using Galant; designed<br>
to showcase some of the newer Galant facilities.<br>
<br>
Among these are:<br>
- hideLabel() and showLabel() for graph elements -- a new "visible"<br>
attribute that's used during algorithm execution<br>
- hide() and show() for graph elements -- a new "hidden" attribute<br>
- color() for graph elements with two arguments: the element and a color<br>
string (which may have declared constants in Algorithm.java); also<br>
uncolor()<br>
<br>
<br><hr>
<li><b><a href=bubble_sort.alg>bubble_sort.alg</a></b> 

An animation of bubble sort.<br>
<br>
Caution: assumes that the graph is a collection of nodes with no edges<br>
weight of node = sorting key<br>
this is the simplest version of bubble sort; makes a pass over the whole<br>
list each iteration<br>
<br>
<br><hr>
<li><b><a href=dfs.alg>dfs.alg</a></b> 
<br>
Implements depth-first search of a graph, directed or undirected; in the<br>
undirected case, it behaves as if edges were directed in both directions.<br>
<br>
<br><hr>
<li><b><a href=dfs_d.alg>dfs_d.alg</a></b> 
<br>
Implements depth-first search of a directed graph only; directedness is<br>
forced at the beginning of the algorithm.<br>
<br>
<br><hr>
<li><b><a href=dijkstra.alg>dijkstra.alg</a></b> 

Implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. Interprets<br>
undirected edges as going in both directions.<br>
<br>
<br><hr>
<li><b><a href=euclidian.alg>euclidian.alg</a></b> 
<br>

Implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. Interprets<br>
undirected edges as going in both directions if run in undirected<br>
mode. Unlike dijkstra.alg, the edge weights are set initially by the<br>
algorithm, based on Euclidian distances between nodes.<br>
<br>
<br><hr>
<li><b><a href=grid.alg>grid.alg</a></b> 
<br>
- creates a grid graph with dimensions supplied by user
<br>
<br><hr>
<li><b><a href=insertion_sort.alg>insertion_sort.alg</a></b> 

An animation of insertion sort.<br>
<br>
Caution: assumes that the graph is a collection of nodes with no edges<br>
weight of node = sorting key; this can also be set up with an external<br>
filter that transforms a list of numbers into the appropriate graph (with<br>
nodes already lined up<br>
<br>
The already sorted part of the array is visited'. The element to be<br>
inserted moves about the array -- the element to which it is compared at<br>
each step is selected.<br>
<br>
<br><hr>
<li><b><a href=interactive_dfs.alg>interactive_dfs.alg</a></b> 
<br>
- implements depth-first search of a directed graph
only; directedness is forced at the beginning of the algorithm; allows<br>
user to specify start node and next node to visit if a visit call returns<br>
without visiting all nodes<br>
<br>
<br><hr>
<li><b><a href=kruskal.alg>kruskal.alg</a></b> 
<br>
@file kruskal.alg<br>
animation of Kruskal's MST algorithm<br>
<br>
<br><hr>
<li><b><a href=quicksort.alg>quicksort.alg</a></b> 

An animation of Quicksort<br>
<em>[author: Hayden Fuss, Solomon Yeh, Jordan Connor]</em><br>
@date 2015/4/28<br>
Submitted for Project 3 in CSC 316<br>
<br>
Caution: assumes that the graph is a collection of nodes with no edges<br>
weight of node = sorting key;<br>
Inital position of the Nodes does not affect output<br>
<br>
This Quicksort implementation chooses the median index of the list<br>
as the pivot, and can handle an arbitrary sized array, but<br>
visual fidelity may fall on larger indices<br>
<br>
<br><hr>
<li><b><a href=strip_attributes.alg>strip_attributes.alg</a></b> 
<br>
- strips out unneccessary attributes from graphs
created before the cleaner handling of attributes was put in place; or<br>
from ones where weights, labels and colors were created inadvertently<br>
during editing.<br>
<br>
<br><hr>
<li><b><a href=test.alg>test.alg</a></b> 
Scaffoling for a variety of tests<br>
<br><hr>
<li><b><a href=test_edge_sorting.alg>test_edge_sorting.alg</a></b> 
<br>
Tests use of Collections.sort() on the edges<br>
<br>
<br><hr>
<li><b><a href=test_infinite_loop.alg>test_infinite_loop.alg</a></b> 
<br><hr>
<li><b><a href=test_macro.alg>test_macro.alg</a></b> 
<br>
- simple test of the for_nodes macro with no animations
<br>
</ul>
