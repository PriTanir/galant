May 20: 2 hours  
	- Reading macro, CodeIntegrator.java, LogHelper.java, and CompilerAndLoader.java 
	- Looking to make change on LogHelper so it can print out the line number along with source code on console. It can be helpful when debugging.

May 21: 2 hours
	- Reading Macro.java and Macros.java.
	- Made minor changes on LogHelper.java and CodeIntegrator.java.
	
May 22: 5 hours
	- Created new_eculidian.alg and new_bubble_sort.alg for testing. They are formatted into expected input pattern. (e.g: new_function(), algorithm{} … )
	- Made changes in Marcos.java. Macros now transfer function() into static methods.  		- For the purpose of minimizing modification on original code, I added a  new macro syntax “new_function”. It should be equivalent to the old “function“. 
	- Algorithm{} is still not responding properly.   
	- Since recursive mechanism is not used any more, looking to remove some unnecessary structure  within new_function macro.
	 
May 27: 2 hours
	- Still trying to figure out why getNodes will get an NullPointerException when hit compile.
	- Looking to create Macro that declares and initializes a list. The list contains current nodes on the graph.(Works as the same as e.g: “final Node [] parent = new Node[ getNodes ]”)

May 29: 5 hours
	- Creating a new Macro. Have to find out a way to handle regular expression. :( (Need to remove the old expression and add the new one into algorithm{} but  Matcher.Replacement is not useful anymore.) 

May 31: 3 hours
	- Learning about regular expression and Matcher/Pattern in JAVA from online resources.
	- Still work on creating the new macro.

June 2: 3 hours
	- new_krusal.alg is working now.
	- Should be testing the new macro on other algorithms in the future. 
	- Making more changes on this macro.

June 4: 4 hours
	- Created FetchingMaro.java. It runs now but has minor issues. 
	- Need to disable macro translation in comment lines.
	- Need to make more Java documentation.
	- Wish to enable macro syntax highlight in the future.
	- Wish to add more exception handle in newly created files.

June 6: 2 hours 
	- Documented FetchingMaro.java.
	- Keep getting Java regex look-behind group exception when dealing with comment lines. 
	- Wish to add feature “Load compiled algorithm”.

June 7: 2 hours
	- trying to add highlight macro syntax in GalantEditor. 
	- trying to figure out how to resolve the comment line problem.
	- Will be working on “Load compiled algorithm” in the next iteration .

June 13: 5 hours 
	- Working on “Load compiled algorithm”. 

June 14: 5 hours
	- .class file now can be loaded. 
June 19: 4 hours
	- trying to make improvement and fix bugs in codeIntegrator.java
