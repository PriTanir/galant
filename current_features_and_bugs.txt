Current Galant bugs and features:

Features:
—————————-

- an array with node or edge indices can now be handled as follows:
	type A[] = new type[nodeIds()]  // allocates enough space for largest id
        type x = A[id(n)]               // access element corresponding to node n
Here A is an array of elements of the given type


Either Feature or Bug:
—————————————————————— 

- if user creates a node using ctrl-n while in create edge mode, the node is created with an edge attached to it

- binary tree algorithm, or any other algorithm that creates nodes and does not declare node movement allows users to move nodes and to save the new positions via export
[this has been fixed; turns out it happened only when binary_tree was preceded by an algorithm that moves nodes; now algorithmMovesNodes is initialized to false by algorithm initialize() method and user movement is allowed; graph stays in position set by user]

- attempt to delete an edge via del-e when no edge exists with the given endpoints does not result in any error or warning.

- modes are annoying; if you happen to be in add node, add edge, or, worse, delete mode, you can easily forget and accidentally do something unintended; editing needs to be mode free; the best way to do this is to emulate the keyboard shortcuts via mouse "commands", i.e., use the shift and/or ctrl keys along with mouse clicks

- boolean values default to false if they're missing; might have unintended side effects

Bugs:
————-

- display states keep incrementing after algorithm is through running even though the forward button is greyed out; probably an easy fix

- layered graph algorithms barycenter and mce get into busy wait loops after a few steps; I’m guessing it’s at the point where they move nodes; there is likely to be a serious conflict between positions as determined by x and y coordinates and those determined by layer and positionInLayer

- getDestNode(() should not have been eliminated entirely; also, all method calls of the form element.method() should have an algorithm call of the form method(element)

- syntax highlighting for algorithm methods needs to be updated

- attributes other than the essential ones go away if any editing takes place; need to examine what happens when the dispatcher pushes changes

- id's, sources, and targets for edges end up being duplicated when a graph is exported during execution
