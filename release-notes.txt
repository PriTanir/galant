Release notes for Galant, most recent first.

v5.4 (upcoming)

User

- selected edges are dashed during editing, nodes are shaded cyan

- visibility of labels/weights on nodes/edges can be toggled during execution, either by the algorithm or by the user

- faster reaction to display state changes

- elimination of a bug that caused Galant to hang if animation was terminated
  during an active query or sometimes in the middle of an algorithm that did
  lots of possibly unmatched beginStep()'s and endSteps()'s

Animator

- functions getNode(String prompt, NodeSet set, String errorMessage) and the
  corresponding one for edges, to prompt the user for a node/edge and require
  that it be in a specified set; the errorMessage is reported if the
  node/edge is not in the set

- new NodePriorityQueue and EdgePriorityQueue methods as well as ability to
  define a max heap using an optional boolean argument; these include
  removeMax, removeBest and changeKey (as an alternative to decreaseKey)

- functions that return sets of neighbors, incident edges, incoming edges and
  outgoing edges for a node (instead of lists) [still in the works]

- functions that sets of return *visible* neighbors, etc.

- function step() that is essentially synonym for 'endStep(); beginStep()';
  allows setting of generic breakpoints without worrying about matched pairs;
  used in dominance.alg and interactive_dfs.alg

- more protection from Java null pointer and other low level exceptions

Developer

- put NodePriorityQueue and EdgePriorityQueue into the graph.container package
