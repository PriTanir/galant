    \hline
    \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\textbf{message}}
    & \textbf{type/source}
    & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\textbf{explanation}} \\
    \hline
    programmer message $m$ & runtime
    & animation program has encountered an \Code{error($m$)} call
    \\
    \hline
    programmer message $m$ & runtime
    & user selected a node or edge not in the set specified by a query of the
    form \Code{getNode/getEdge($p$, $S$, $m$)}, where $p$ is the prompt, $S$
    the set, and $m$ the error message 
    \\
    \hline
    Nonexistent node or edge & runtime
    & a node/edge is null or does not exist in current state
    \\
    \hline
    Graph element has no weight & runtime
    & no weight was given, neither during editing nor earlier during execution
    \\
    \hline
    No edge with source $v$ and target $w$ exists & runtime
    & can occur when user responds to a query for an edge or the algorithm asks
    for a specific edge using \Code{getEdge($v,w$)}
    \\
    \hline
    Empty graph & runtime & animation attempts to get a node when there is
    none
    \\
    \hline
    No node with id $i$ exists & runtime
    & called \Code{getNodeById($i$)} when no node with id $i$ exists
    \\
    \hline
    Node has been deleted & runtime
    & called \Code{getNodeById($i$)} when node has been deleted
    \\
    \hline
    Attempt to removeMin from max heap (or vice versa) & runtime
    & priority queues can be initialized as either min heaps or max heaps;
    Galant checks to make sure the correct remove method is used
    \\
    \hline
    Attempt to add null node/edge to (priority) queue & runtime
    & what it says, prevents later problem with null element
    \\
    \hline
    Unable to compute center for node & any time
    & something got messed up with the x and y coordinates (or the layer
    information in case of a layered graph), e.g., with a \Code{setPosition}
    call
    \\
    \hline
    Something went wrong when processing algorithm block & macro processing
    & probably some unbalanced parentheses, braces or brackets in the algorithm
    \\
    \hline
    Missing \emph{right parenthesis, bracket, brace} in \emph{code} \ldots
    & macro processing
    & what it says; the \emph{code} shows only the beginning of the code
    block in which the error occurred
    \\
    \hline
    \emph{macro name}: Curly braces required & macro processing
    & missing curly braces after a function header
    \\
    \hline
    No compiler found, need a JDK & compiler
    & either no JDK is installed or \Code{JAVA\_HOME} is not set up correctly
    \\
    \hline
    Invalid tab - use untitled graph or untitled algorithm & text editor
    & attempt to save a file when there's something wrong with the current
    tab/panel (should not happen)
    \\
    \hline
    No text when invoking GraphMLParser & GraphML parser
    & attempting to parse empty file
    \\
    \hline
    Missing id for node & GraphML parser
    & no id specified for the node; nodes are required to have id's; they are
    optional for edges
    \\
    \hline
    Bad id & GraphML parser
    & the id of a node or edge is not an integer
    \\
    \hline
    Duplicate id $i$ & GraphML parser
    & there is more than node/edge with id $i$
    \\
    \hline
    Missing source/target & GraphML parser
    & an edge has no source/target in its GraphML representation
    \\
    \hline
    Bad source/target id & GraphML parser
    & the source/target specified in the GraphML file is not a legal integer
    \\
    \hline
    Source/target node missing & GraphML parser
    & the integer id of the source/target does not correspond with any node
    \\
    \hline
    Bad weight & GraphML parser
    & the weight of a node/edge is not a valid floating point number
    \\
    \hline
    Bad x/y-coordinate & GraphML parser
    & the x or y coordinate of a node is not a legal integer
    \\
    \hline
    Missing/bad layer/positionInLayer & GraphML parser
    & something is wrong with layer or positionInLayer of a node in a layered
    graph
    \\
    \hline
