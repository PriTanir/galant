Animations are generated using a visual editor, by scripting or via API calls. All animations can be edited visually. ANIMAL supports source and pseudo code inclusion and highlighting as well as precise user-defined delays between actions. The paper evaluates the functionality of ANIMAL in comparison to other animation tools.}

classic hypertextbooks, being a close integration of text
and images with interactive visualizations/simulations and
assessment activities. The OpenDSA project is meant to
proceed with broad participation from the CS Education
community, with maximum 
exibility on reuse of materials,
and with the ability for a given instructor to pick and
choose material from the collection and modify as desired.
We discuss the goals of the project, our initial community
organization efforts, and the technical infrastructure that we
envision for the project. Initial progress is described.}
