\input{Y_dfs_animation}

Fig.~\ref{fig:dfs} illustrates an animation of depth-first search.
The code and definitions follow those of Cormen et al.~\cite{2009-Intro_to_Algorithms-Cormen}.
Tree edges are highlighted (selected)
and non-tree edges are labeled as \textbf{B}ack edges,
\textbf{F}orward edges or \textbf{C}ross edges.
White nodes, not yet visited,
are neither highlighted (selected) nor marked;
Gray nodes, visited but the visit is not finished, are highlighted only;
and black nodes, visit is completed, are both highlighted and 
marked.
Labels on nodes indicate the discovery and finish times, separated by a slash.

This particular algorithm, unlike our implementation of Dijkstra's,
is intended for a directed graph.
We would
need to write a different algorithm/animation
to deal with tree
edges that get relabeled as back edges when treated as bidirectional.
