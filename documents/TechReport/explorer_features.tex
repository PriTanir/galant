\subsection{For the explorer}
\label{sec:explorer}

As is the case with GDR the role of observer and explorer are conflated in that
the explorer can change the graph instance via the same interface as running the
algorithm. As already pointed out, that same interface provides conveniences
to the animator as well.

\cmt{Note that the observer role differs from the explorer only in that the
  observer fails to take advantage of editing the graph, a limitation that is
  anticipated only for users not familiar with graphs; deal with this point
  under UI below?}
