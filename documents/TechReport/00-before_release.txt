Things to do before release:

- proofread all 0-* documents
- proofread the whole tech report
- spellcheck everything
- make sure all algorithms and user operations work as advertised
- add new functions to syntax highlighting
- update the release number in Galant.java
- get most recent GPL (the one in 0-gpl.txt is 1991)
- check with csc_help about best way to make everything public
- add github information to the tech report (first page)
