One of the simplest algorithms we have implemented is Dijkstra's algorithm
for the single source shortest paths problem.
Fig.~\ref{fig:dijkstra}
the implementation of the animation of Dijkstra's algorithm.
At every step the nodes already in the shortest path tree are \emph{marked}
(gray shading) and the nodes that have been encountered (but are not in the tree)
are \emph{highlighted} (thick red boundary); these are often referred to as
\emph{frontier} nodes.
Selected \emph{edges} (thick red) represent the current shortest paths to all
encountered nodes;
they are the edges of a shortest path tree when the algorithm is done.
The same algorithm animation
works for both directed and undirected graphs, as illustrated
in Figs.~\ref{fig:dijkstra_directed} and~\ref{fig:dijkstra_undirected}.
The user can toggle between the directed and undirected versions of a graph
via push of the appropriate button.
The functions \emph{beginStep} and \emph{endStep} define the points at which
the exploration of the algorithm stops its forward or backward motion.
In their absence, any state change (mark, select, change in weight, etc.)
constitutes a step, which, in some cases, can force the user
to do excessive ``stepping'' to move past uninteresting state changes.

The macro \emph{for\_outgoing($v,e,w$)}
creates a loop whose body is executed once
for each edge leading out of $v$; in the body, $e$ refers to the current edge
and $w$ to the other endpoint (any other variable names can be used).
In an undirected graph the term \emph{outgoing} applies to all incident
edges.\footnote{
Also provided are \emph{for\_incoming} and \emph{for\_adjacent};
the latter applies to all incident edges, even for directed graphs.
}

The difference between what the algorithm does on a directed versus an undirected graph is evident in the figures.
The edge \emph{from} node~3 to node~2 in the directed graph becomes an
edge \emph{between} the two nodes in the undirected form of the same graph.
Thus, in the undirected version, when node~2 is added to the tree
it also causes the distance from the source, node~0, to node~3 to be updated,
via the path through node~2.
These snapshots come from the executions of the \emph{same algorithm} on the
\emph{same graph}.
The only difference is that the explorer toggled from the directed to
the undirected
interpretation of the graph.

The array \verb+chosenEdge+ is required in order to control the highlighting.
Galant provides for seamless indexing of arrays with node id's: the
function \verb+nodeIds+ simply returns the largest node id plus one
(so that an array can be allocated correctly) and \verb+id(v)+ returns the
id of v, to be used as an index.
Node ids, therefore, need not be contiguous starting at 0, as,
in general, they won't be because of deletions or when graphs
come from external sources.
