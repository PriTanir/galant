and images with interactive visualizations/simulations and
assessment activities. The OpenDSA project is meant to
proceed with broad participation from the CS Education
community, with maximum 
exibility on reuse of materials,
and with the ability for a given instructor to pick and
choose material from the collection and modify as desired.
We discuss the goals of the project, our initial community
organization efforts, and the technical infrastructure that we
envision for the project. Initial progress is described.}
