Testing protocol for Galant.

- create a new graph with two nodes and one edge; give both nodes and the edge a color, weight, and label

- open test (in Example_Graphs) and move some nodes around

- run bfs on eight_node_graph (in Example_Graphs), need node weights only

- run dfs_d on eight_node_graph (in Example_Graphs), need node and edge labels, no weights

- run dijkstra on weighted_example (in Example_Graphs), with graph both undirected and directed; in undirected case, node 3 is distance 2 from the start via path 0-2-3; in the directed case it’s distance 3 via the edge 0->3

- run kruskal on weighted_example, need edge labels only; there’s text commentary

- run insertion_sort on sorting_test (in Example_Graphs), need node weights only

- binary_tree on an empty graph, no weights or labels, try exporting an intermediate state

- load 0_simple (in Crossing_Graphs) and make sure it draws properly (responds to changes in window size)

- run both barycenter and mce (in Crossing-Algorithms) on 1_test (in Crossing Graphs), need node weights for barycenter

- ditto for r_100_110_10_0_0p7 (in Crossing_Graphs)

- run sifting on 1_test
